# Pokemon_Clustering
##The goal of this project is to use kmeans clustering to identify the different types of pokemon.
#For this exercise, we will exclude the pokemon type category so we can focus more on attack, defense, special attack, and speed
#The data was scraped from https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all?source=post_page---------------------------
# and the webscraping project was found at https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-html-tables-with-python-c9baba21059

#Side Note: Personally, I am not very familiar with the pokemon after 300 so some summaries will just have the red/blue 
#pokemon listed in them.
